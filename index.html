<p>This is a responsive wordpress theme developed by Prakash Poudel and uses bootstrap framework and
fontawesome.</p>

<p>This theme is currently being developed to suit the website of programmer where he will ba able
to showcase his projects and applications. The page template that will be suitable as landing page
for applications is being developed. </p>
